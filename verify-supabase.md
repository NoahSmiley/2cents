# Verify Supabase Setup

## ✅ Steps Completed:
1. ✅ Created Supabase account
2. ✅ Got API credentials
3. ✅ Created `.env` file with credentials
4. ✅ Switched app to use Supabase

## 🔧 Next Step: Run the Database Schema

You need to run the SQL schema to create the database tables. Here's how:

### Option 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://app.supabase.com/project/ppnkqmftnieozlafbaso

2. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

3. Click **New Query**

4. Open the file `supabase-schema.sql` in your project folder

5. Copy ALL the SQL code and paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor

6. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

7. You should see "Success. No rows returned" - this means it worked!

### Option 2: Quick Test (Skip schema for now)

If you want to test the auth first:

1. The app should now show a login page
2. Try creating an account
3. You'll get an error about missing tables - that's expected!
4. Then go back and run the schema SQL

## 🎯 What Happens Next:

Once the schema is run:
- ✅ You can create an account
- ✅ Sign in
- ✅ All your data will be stored in Supabase
- ✅ Access from any device!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

**"Invalid API key" error:**
- Restart the dev server (Ctrl+C and `npm run start`)
- Environment variables only load on startup

**"relation does not exist" error:**
- You haven't run the SQL schema yet
- Go to Supabase SQL Editor and run `supabase-schema.sql`

**Can't see login page:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure `.env` file is in the project root
