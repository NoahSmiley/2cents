# Recurring Bills - Complete Feature Set

## 🎯 Core Functionality

### ✅ **What's Implemented**

**1. Racing Green Light Beam Animation**
- Temporary animation that races across the row when marking as paid
- 30% width beam with bright green gradient
- Travels from left (-30%) to right (100%)
- Duration: 0.6s with smooth easing
- Repeats twice for emphasis
- Leaves behind permanent green glow on row

**2. Smart Status Indicators**
- **Red (Overdue)**: Bill is past due and unpaid
- **Amber (Due Soon)**: Bill due within 3 days
- **Blue (Upcoming)**: Bill is upcoming (>3 days away)
- **Green (Paid)**: Bill marked as paid this cycle
- All indicators have glowing shadows for visibility
- Indicator pulses when celebrating

**3. Inline Editing**
- Click "Edit" button to enter edit mode
- Edit name, amount, and due day directly in the table
- "Save" commits changes, "Cancel" reverts
- Auto-focus on name field when editing starts
- Input validation (amount must be number, day 1-31)

**4. Recurring Bill Logic**
- Bills automatically track their billing cycle
- Cycle starts from the most recent due date ≤ today
- When marked paid, the `lastPaid` date is recorded
- Next month, when the new cycle begins, bill automatically reappears as unpaid
- Paid bills move to bottom, unpaid bills stay at top

**5. Table Sorting**
- **Unpaid bills first** (sorted by due date - overdue → soon → upcoming)
- **Paid bills last** (sorted by due date)
- Smooth animated reordering using Framer Motion's `layout` prop

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Status Color System

## 🔧 Feature Details

### Bill Actions
**For Unpaid Bills:**

- **Edit**: Enter inline edit mode

- **Edit**: Enter inline edit mode

### Recurring Cycle Logic

**How Cycles Work:**
1. Each bill has a `dueDay` (1-31 of the month)
2. System calculates the "cycle start" = most recent due date ≤ today
3. Bill is "paid this cycle" if `lastPaid` date ≥ cycle start
4. When a new cycle begins (next month), bill automatically becomes unpaid

**Example:**
```
Bill: Rent, Due Day: 1st of month
- Jan 15: Mark paid → lastPaid = "2025-01-15"
- Jan 16-31: Shows as "Paid" (green)
- Feb 1: New cycle begins → Shows as "Unpaid" (blue/amber/red)
- Feb 1-28: Can mark paid again for February
```

## 📊 User Experience

### Information Hierarchy
1. **Status indicator** - Immediate visual cue
2. **Bill name** - What you're paying
3. **Amount** - How much
4. **Due date** - When it's due (with countdown)
5. **Status badge** - Text confirmation
6. **Actions** - What you can do

### Smart Sorting
- **Overdue bills** bubble to the very top (urgent!)
- **Due soon bills** come next (attention needed)
- **Upcoming bills** follow (plan ahead)
- **Paid bills** sink to bottom (out of the way)

### Helpful Tips
Bottom of screen shows:
> 💡 **Tip:** Bills automatically reset each cycle based on their due date. 
> Paid bills move to the bottom and will reappear at the top when the next cycle begins.

## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
- bills: Bill[]              // All bills

todayISO()           // Get today's date
cycleStart(date, day) // Calculate cycle start
nextDueDate(day)     // Calculate next due date
daysBetween(a, b)    // Days between dates
